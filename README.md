# Clibsane

This swift package makes LibSane available as Clang module. LibSane is the C API for SANE, and I want to write a swifty wrapper for it. Anyone can fetch this package in order to import the C lib.

## Installation

1. Make sure that you have HomeBrew installed
2. brew Install sane-backends
3. Create a swift package and Add this repository to its dependencies
4. Import and use Clibsane in your code
5. Build
